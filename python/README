Here you will find some examples of python scripts and some evaluation
routines. The python interface for libaubio is generated using Swig.

To have it working before installation, you will need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../src/.libs:../ext/.libs
for instance, to run the python script from within aubio/python/.
