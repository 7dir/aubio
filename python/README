# Here you will find some examples of python scripts and some evaluation
# routines. The python interface for libaubio is generated using Swig.

# To have it working before installation, you will need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
# for instance, to run the python script from within aubio/python/, you can use
# sh ./README

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../src/.libs:../ext/.libs
